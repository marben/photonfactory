* cmake is used to build the project


* Dependencies:

libpng
libxml2
libeigen3

* Generating eclipse cdt project files:
cmake ../project_dir -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"

if eclipse complains about cout cmath and other standard libraries, try clicking right mouse on the project ->Index->Search for unresolved includes
this will show you the missing includes(probably something included by the standard headers themselves). add the directory to the Project->properties->c++ include paths and symbols
